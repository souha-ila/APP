## Abstract 

Our project consists of the creation, analysis, design and implementation of a dynamic website
 of Morocco. To carry out our work, we divided the project into several stages.
 
 At the beginning, we defined the general context of the project, and we adopted as a project management approach, The Unified Modelling Language **(UML)**, which is a graphic modelling language based on pictograms designed as a standardized method of visualization, in the areas of software development and object-oriented design.
 
 Then, we approached the design phase to properly structure the business layer of our application.
 
 Finally, the last step was the realization and the implementation of  our APP.
