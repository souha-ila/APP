## Abstract 

Our project consists of the creation, analysis, design and implementation of a dynamic website
 of Morocco. To carry out our work, we divided the project into several stages.
 
 At the beginning, we defined the general context of the project, and we adopted as a project management approach, The Unified Modelling Language **(UML)**, which is a graphic modelling language based on pictograms designed as a standardized method of visualization, in the areas of software development and object-oriented design.
 
 Then, we approached the design phase to properly structure the business layer of our application.
 
 Finally, the last step was the realization and the implementation of  our APP.

## Realization

The site home page is as follows:

![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/souha-ila/APP/main/home.png)

 At the top of the page we have the Flag of Morocco.
  This flag, which dates back to 1912, is red with, in its center, a green pentacle (five-pointed star) known as Solomon.
  Red and green are the traditional colors of Arab flags, although the use of red is more commonly associated with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. 
  The pentacle represents the pillars of Islam and five signifies the bond between God and the nation.
  
  Below the logo we have the menu of our site which is displayed horizontally
